This project is a simple nine to five work planner, something you can set small or large task reminders in before work starts at nine, and check throughout the day.
In the header the current date and time is displayed. 
The main body of the page contains nine rows for each respective hour in the work day, these rows have three collumns. Each row consists of a main input collumn where you enter the tasks you wish to be reminded of, and another collumn where a save button is, so that you can set that particular rows input into local storage so you may close your browser or refresh the page and it will still be there. There is also a clear button in this collumn to delete any unwanted or completed tasks. 
This work diary is colour coded, red row signals that hour has passed, grey meaning this is the hour you are in and green meaning it is an hour still to come. 
The input sections have an overflow feature so you can type far more than just the actual space you can see, as you will be presented with a scroll tool.
